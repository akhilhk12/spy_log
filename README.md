# spy_log
This project  has an implementation of a simple keylogger written in C#
To run the program either:
  1. clone the repo and build the project in visual studio code.
  2. Run the build WindowsFormsApp1.exe in the bin/Debug folder.

The program will run in the background intercepting keystrokes and forming sentences. Once the user presses enter/"." the logger appends the sentece to a log file created in the directory in which the build is present.
